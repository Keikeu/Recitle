      `The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van The Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
And now I'm singing like`,

      `Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead`,

      `I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body`,

      `Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Oh I oh I oh I oh I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you`,

      `One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
And leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
And I'm singing like`,

      `Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

      `The nightclub? Not ideal for sparks to fly.
You want real chemistry? Head to your local bar!
Grab your pals, round up some shots!
Sip quick — but speak smooth.
Then someone strolls up, just chatting with you,
Give 'em a shot — it's a once-in-a-lifetime deal!
Take their hand, spin that jukebox magic,
Cue a classic, let the rhythm lead,
And suddenly — boom — you're singing along.`,

      `Hey there, you're chasing that custom-made affection.
That handcrafted kind, tailor-fit to your vibe.
Step up, follow where the fun flows.

Just hold on tight, feel the spark.
No overthinking — just go with the beat.
Yeah, lean in, just follow that groove.`,

      `You're vibing with their silhouette, no doubt.
You two click — push and pull like magic.
Even your heart’s syncing up to the rhythm.
You’re drawn in, totally hooked.
Last night, they were chillin' in your space.
Now everything smells like "them" — wild, right?
Each day? A brand-new chapter.
You’re head-over-heels for their whole vibe.`,

      `Whoa now, whoa now, slow that roll —
You’re all in on the silhouette.
Whoa now, whoa now, can't shake it —
That body’s got you hypnotized.
Whoa now, whoa now, it’s magnetic —
You're loving every bit.
New feels every morning, like clockwork.
Yeah, you're sold on the whole design.`,

      `Seven days in, you're living the movie.
First official date night? Let’s gooo!
You're frugal — buffet? Say no more!
Fill your tote, pile your plate — win-win!
Chit-chat all night — sweet stuff, sour stuff,
Family updates, deep dives — it’s real!
Then roll out in a taxi, smooch in the back,
Tell the driver: crank those jams!
And boom — that song hits, you're feelin’ it.`,

      `Have you got colour in your cheeks?
Do you ever get that fear that you can't shift
The type that sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found that makes me think of you somehow and I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee`,

      `(Do I wanna know?)
If this feeling flows both ways?
(Sad to see you go)
Was sort of hoping that you'd stay
(Baby, we both know)
That the nights were mainly made for saying things that you can't say tomorrow day`,

      `Crawling back to you`,

      `Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through`,

      `Crawling back to you`,

      `So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open and if so I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt. It's just I'm constantly on the cusp of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
But we could be together if you wanted to`,

      `You ever feel like something’s planted in your head?
Like a coded message you can’t unsee, stuck in your teeth?
You think maybe they’re hiding tricks up their sleeve?
Wake up, you’re deeper in this than you realize.
Been dreaming about the same subject — every night this week.
Coincidence? Doubt it.
How many secrets are they storing?
Found a looped signal — a melody that triggers memories of you.
Been playing it nonstop… ‘til I black out.
Evidence: beverage spillage during playback.`,

      `(Is it mutual infiltration?)
You leaving felt too clean.
Almost like someone didn’t want you to stay.
We both know — those late nights? Prime time for real talk.
Stuff you can’t say when the sun’s up.`,

      `Backtracking again. Classic.`,

      `Ever get the urge to call after a few drinks?
It’s always then — predictable pattern.
Maybe I’m already too deep in this operation to notice new players.
Finally started putting the puzzle together.`,

      `Yup. Returning to point of origin.`,

      `You got the nerve for this?
Is your emotional firewall still down? If yes — I need timestamps.
Calm your frequencies. Prep for contact.
Apologies for the interference — this signal’s hard to suppress.
I’m always on the verge of making a move.
No clue if your reception’s tuned to mine.
But if we synced up? The possibilities…`,

      `(Repeat query: Is this two-way traffic?)
You disappearing wasn’t random.
Kinda hoped you’d ignore the exit protocol.
Let’s face it — those late transmissions?
They carry the real data.`,

      `Return sequence initiated. (Yep, again.)`,

      `Thought about calling after exposure? (You always do.)
That makes two of us.
Maybe I’m too embedded in this mission to recruit someone new.
Assessment updated post-analysis.`,

      `Back at square one.`,

      `(Is this loop mutual?)
Still feeling the disconnect.
Still wondering if you’d break silence.
Still decoding what this all meant during the night ops.`,

      `(Do I even want the truth?)
Already compromised by you.
Did you ever plan to reestablish contact?
Bottom line — am I supposed to keep crawling back into this?`,

      `Mr. President, we operate in tandem,
With a synergy stronger than nature’s own design.
Together, we shift the course of events,
Even the seasons bend when you're near — December feels like July.`,

      `Sir, I have navigated chaos — stood atop wreckage, staggered from tumult.
Yet in darkness, I am drawn to your guidance — insatiably.
You are both my cure and my affliction, a constant presence in my thoughts.
Frankly, it's undeniable.`,

Your directives? I follow without hesitation or question.
Indeed, wherever you lead, I will be in pursuit.
You influence me in ways unknown to others.
You disrupt my patterns, rewrite my rules,
And the truth is clear: I am wholly committed to you.`,

You understand me intimately — as I do you.
The details blur in your presence —
Nights once remembered, now vanish when you're near.`,

Yet I pursue your path, undeterred, drawn to your light.
You're the salve and the sting, etched permanently in my consciousness.
Mr. President, the signs are evident.`,

      `I remain devoted to you.
Speak, and I will respond without delay.
I walk every path you mark, without fail.
You hold a truth no one else perceives.
You compel me to abandon the expected, to step outside the mold.
It is, without doubt, because of you.`,

Once more, I’ve walked through uncertainty and missteps,
Yet I follow where you go, unsatisfied until I do.
You reside within my mind — an indelible force.
Mr. President, there’s no denying it now.`,

      `You have my full allegiance.
You call, and I arrive, no questions asked.
You lead, and I follow, without pause.
There are details only I know of you,
And because of them, you dismantle my old self and summon the new.
It's a fact: I am entirely yours.
Yes, sir — I'm yours.`,

And verily, there was a maiden.
Couldst thou make it more plain?
The lad was of rebellious spirit.
And the maiden did dance with grace.
What further could be spoken?
The lad’s heart longed for her.
Yet she held her tongue.
And behold, in secret, her heart did yearn likewise.
But her companions, haughty in spirit, turned up their noses.
For they were displeased by the raiment he wore, baggy and unrefined.`,

She had need to descend, and return unto the earth.`,

He who glideth upon the pavement, rising in fame upon the scrolls of MTV.
She rang her companions, who knew already.
Yea, they held passes to his gathering.
She journeyed forth, stood amidst the multitude,
And lifted her gaze unto the man she once refused.`,

Striking his instrument with fervor.
Doth her fair countenance now perceive his worth?`,

The man that the boy was destined to become.
For beneath the flesh dwelleth a soul of light, hidden from thine eyes.`,

      `Occasionally, we reflect on the relationships that once brought us joy and connection
We recall moments where we felt so alive, so fulfilled, that it seemed like everything was perfect
But in hindsight, it’s clear that the emotional connection didn’t fully meet our needs
We were made to believe we were aligned, but in reality, we were left feeling isolated in the very company we thought would bring us comfort
Yet, we learned, and the pain still serves as a reminder of what it means to truly grow`,

      `We often find ourselves attached to the familiar feeling of sadness, as though it has become a part of us
We resign ourselves to the belief that it’s just the way things are—always an ending, never a beginning
But as we reach the point of realization, we understand that sometimes endings offer us clarity
We tell ourselves we will remain friends, but deep down, we recognize the freedom that comes when we let go`,

      `There is no need to carry the weight of unnecessary emotional baggage
You didn't need to dismiss me or pretend that our experiences never mattered
Our connection was important, but I no longer need your validation
I refuse to allow your actions to dictate how I feel
You treated me as though I were irrelevant, a stranger—and this behavior only reinforces the necessity of moving on
You've chosen to remove yourself, and that's okay; now, you are simply a chapter I once lived`,

      `And now, you exist as a distant memory—someone I once knew`,

      `From time to time, I reflect on the way past betrayals were framed as my fault
I accepted the blame, not realizing that it wasn't entirely mine to carry
I don’t want to live in a state of constant self-doubt, analyzing every word and action, trying to piece together what went wrong
You promised me closure, but the fact that you're still hanging onto what we had shows that there’s still work left to do on both sides`,

      `It's important to remember that there is no need to allow someone to take away your peace of mind by dismissing you entirely
You don’t have to let their actions define your self-worth
Even when it feels like they’ve erased your existence, it's crucial to remind yourself that you can stand on your own
The changes they made are just signs of their own unresolved issues, not a reflection of who you are
And now, you've become a past version of someone I once knew`,

Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not

Her hand marked her brow as the rebels’ fate was set`,

Bound by the Code, I draw my saber and fight
The galaxy’s chaos does not prevent the thrill
The Force sharpens the mind, but war dulls the soul`,

What harm is there in flying the hidden routes?
You’ll never know the path if you don't take it (TAKE IT!)
You’ll never rise if you don’t let the Force flow`,

Now, smuggler, you’re a legend, take the bounty and win
All that glows is stardust
Only the brave ever break the Empire’s grip`,

Strap in now, young one, the danger grows clear
But the droid says differently
Look at the star map, there’s hope to be found`,

      `The ice beneath us cracks with every step
The darkness encroaches, but we must keep moving
My heart’s aflame. What of yours?
I embrace it fully, it will never fade`,

Shivers be runnin’ down me spine, me bones be achin’ like a mast in a storm!  
Farewell, me hearties, I must set sail,  
Leave ye all behind and face the gallows’ noose!  
Mother, arrr (where’er the wind blows),  
I wish not to perish,  
Some nights I be wishin’ I’d ne’er been born at all!`,

      `I spy a tiny silhouette o’ a scallywag!  
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will ye dance the fandango?  
Thunder and cannon-fire be strikin’ me timbers!  
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnificent rogue!
But I be but a poor soul, none give a damn fer me!  
He be but a poor soul from a lowly crew,  
Spare him this fate, let him be free!`,

      `Easy come, easy go, will ye let me go?
By Davy Jones’ cursed name,  
Nay! We shall not let ye go! (Let him go!)  
By Davy Jones’ cursed name,  
We shall not let ye go! (Let him go!)  
By Davy Jones’ cursed name,  
We shall not let ye go! (Let me go!)  
Shall not let ye go! (Let me go!)  
Shall not let ye go! (Ne’er, ne’er, ne’er shall we let ye go!)  
Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay!`,

      `Blimey! Mamma mia, mamma mia!  
Mamma mia, set me free!  
Beelzebub’s got a devil markin’ me for the deep,  
For me! For me! For meeeeee!
So ye think ye can strike me and spit in me eye?  
So ye think ye can love me, then leave me to die?  
Arrr, ye scurvy dog, ye can’t do this to me!  
I must break free, I must escape this blasted place!`,

      `Oooooh,  
Oooooh, aye! Oooooh, aye!
Naught be matterin’, any soul can see,  
Naught be matterin’,  
Naught be matterin’ to meeeee...`,

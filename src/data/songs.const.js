Season ticket on a one way ride
Asking nothing, leave me be
Taking everythin' in my stride
Don't need reason, don't need rhyme
Ain't nothing I'd rather do
Goin' down, party time
My friends are gonna be there too, yeah`,

Been ridin' solo through these lonesome nights.

Just a gentle touch from you fires me right up.`,

Like when you said you felt so happy you could die
Told myself that you were right for me
But felt so lonely in your company
But that was love and it's an ache I still remember`,

      `You can get addicted to a certain kind of sadness
Like resignation to the end, always the end

Well you said that we would still be friends
But I'll admit that I was glad that it was over`,

Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing

Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know`,

      `Occasionally, we reflect on the relationships that once brought us joy and connection
We recall moments where we felt so alive, so fulfilled, that it seemed like everything was perfect
But in hindsight, it’s clear that the emotional connection didn’t fully meet our needs
We were made to believe we were aligned, but in reality, we were left feeling isolated in the very company we thought would bring us comfort
Yet, we learned, and the pain still serves as a reminder of what it means to truly grow`,

      `We often find ourselves attached to the familiar feeling of sadness, as though it has become a part of us
We resign ourselves to the belief that it’s just the way things are—always an ending, never a beginning
But as we reach the point of realization, we understand that sometimes endings offer us clarity
We tell ourselves we will remain friends, but deep down, we recognize the freedom that comes when we let go`,

      `There is no need to carry the weight of unnecessary emotional baggage
You didn't need to dismiss me or pretend that our experiences never mattered
Our connection was important, but I no longer need your validation
I refuse to allow your actions to dictate how I feel
You treated me as though I were irrelevant, a stranger—and this behavior only reinforces the necessity of moving on
You've chosen to remove yourself, and that's okay; now, you are simply a chapter I once lived`,

      `And now, you exist as a distant memory—someone I once knew`,

      `From time to time, I reflect on the way past betrayals were framed as my fault
I accepted the blame, not realizing that it wasn't entirely mine to carry
I don’t want to live in a state of constant self-doubt, analyzing every word and action, trying to piece together what went wrong
You promised me closure, but the fact that you're still hanging onto what we had shows that there’s still work left to do on both sides`,

      `It's important to remember that there is no need to allow someone to take away your peace of mind by dismissing you entirely
You don’t have to let their actions define your self-worth
Even when it feels like they’ve erased your existence, it's crucial to remind yourself that you can stand on your own
The changes they made are just signs of their own unresolved issues, not a reflection of who you are
And now, you've become a past version of someone I once knew`,

There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti

To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows

God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner

Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged

But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
All the pain inside amplified by the
Fact that I can't get by with my 9-to-5
And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not

Fed to the rules and I hit the ground running
Didn't make sense not to live for fun

So what's wrong with taking the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go
You'll never shine if you don't glow`,

      `A wise Jedi once spoke, the galaxy will guide me,
I’m no Master, I’m still learning the ways of the Force
She stood with a blaster, a smirk on her face,
Her hand marked her brow as the rebels’ fate was set`,

Bound by the Code, I draw my saber and fight
The galaxy’s chaos does not prevent the thrill
The Force sharpens the mind, but war dulls the soul`,

      `So much to see in this vast, endless space
What harm is there in flying the hidden routes?
You’ll never know the path if you don't take it (TAKE IT!)
You’ll never rise if you don’t let the Force flow`,

      `Now, Jedi, you’re a hero, take your lightsaber and fight
Now, smuggler, you’re a legend, take the bounty and win
All that glows is stardust
Only the brave ever break the Empire’s grip`,

      `The galaxy’s cold, and the dark side’s near
Strap in now, young one, the danger grows clear
But the droid says differently
Look at the star map, there’s hope to be found`,

      `The ice beneath us cracks with every step
The darkness encroaches, but we must keep moving
My heart’s aflame. What of yours?
I embrace it fully, it will never fade`,

I must flee from the Empire’s reach
I said yes, what a mission
I need fuel for my cause, myself
And we all crave a little freedom`,

Mother, arrr (where’er the wind blows),  
I wish not to perish,  
Some nights I be wishin’ I’d ne’er been born at all!`,

      `I spy a tiny silhouette o’ a scallywag!  
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will ye dance the fandango?  
Thunder and cannon-fire be strikin’ me timbers!  
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnificent rogue!
But I be but a poor soul, none give a damn fer me!  
He be but a poor soul from a lowly crew,  
Spare him this fate, let him be free!`,

      `Easy come, easy go, will ye let me go?
By Davy Jones’ cursed name,  
Nay! We shall not let ye go! (Let him go!)  
By Davy Jones’ cursed name,

Nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay, nay!`,

      `Blimey! Mamma mia, mamma mia!  
Mamma mia, set me free!  
Beelzebub’s got a devil markin’ me for the deep,  
For me! For me! For meeeeee!
So ye think ye can strike me and spit in me eye?  
So ye think ye can love me, then leave me to die?  
Arrr, ye scurvy dog, ye can’t do this to me!  
I must break free, I must escape this blasted place!`,

      `Oooooh,  
Oooooh, aye! Oooooh, aye!
Naught be matterin’, any soul can see,  
Naught be matterin’,  
Naught be matterin’ to meeeee...`,

      `White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleeping, you're on your tippy toes
Creeping around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal`,

      `Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please, I do
What I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical`,

Like-it-really-rough guy
Just-can't-get-enough guy
Chest-always-so-puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make-your-mama-sad type
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type
Might-seduce-your-dad type
I'm the bad guy, duh`,

      `I'm the bad guy`,

      `I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal`,

      `My mommy likes to sing along
With me but she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know`,

Bad`,

I guess I'm pretty glad
That you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean
I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne`,

      `White tee now red, 'cause my nose is a crime scene,
You sleepin', but you creeping, always on your tiptoes.
Lurking 'round like no one knows, thinking you're a criminal,
Bruh, you really think you're slick? LMAO, ok, chill.`,

      `Bruises on my knees? Yeah, for you, I'm down.
No “thank you” or “please,” I don’t even need that.
I do what I want, whenever I feel like it,
Soul’s pretty messed up, real cynical with it.`,

      `Oh, you a tough guy?
Big talk, rough vibes, can’t get enough, guy.
Puffed chest, flexin' hard, like a gym rat guy,
I'm the bad type,
Make-your-mom-cry type,
Make-your-girlfriend-mad type,
Might-steal-your-dad type.
I'm the bad guy, duh.`,

      `Yeah, I'm that bad guy.`,

      `I like when you act in charge,
Even though we both know you don't.
You don’t own me, but go ahead, play your role,
I’ll be your animal, if that's what you want.`,

      `My mom vibes with me, sings to my tracks,
But this one? Nah, she won't sing along to that.
She reads the lyrics, and I know she’s shook,
Feeling bad for these dudes, that’s all it took.`,

Bad? Yep, it's what I do best, no cap.`,

      `Love when you get mad, it’s kinda fun.
Guess I'm low-key happy that you're solo.
She said she's scared of me? LMAO, why tho?
I don’t see it, but maybe it’s 'cause I rock your cologne.`,

Bad guy, menace, chaos is my game.
I'm the bad guy.`,

      `As he entered through the casement,  
It was a sound most alarming, swelling in volume like the surging strains of an orchestra reaching its climax.  
He stepped with dreadful intent into her modest dwelling,  
And in his wake, a most grievous stain was left upon the embroidered carpet.  
She, seized with fright, sought refuge beneath the polished mahogany table,  
Yet her trembling limbs did betray her inability to flee.  
He beheld her terror, for she was rendered utterly incapable.  
Thus, in a fit of desperate resolve, she dashed toward her chamber.  
Alas! She was struck down, and fate did decree her doom.`,

Alas!`,

      `And so they came upon the scene with great haste,  
Entering the threshold as if drawn by some grim force.  
It was a Sunday—a day meant for respite, yet rendered dark by villainy.  
They did attempt to restore her with breath,  
Pressing upon her lifeless lips in hope of revival.  
Yet her heart, frail and faltering, gave forth but the faintest of protests.`,

Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality

Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me`,

Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead

Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters`,

Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time

I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all`,

Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
